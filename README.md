For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

### Url
This website use axios to request datas. So I use the vuex to manage the main url. You can change it to your own. The global data is here:`/vuex/index.js`
